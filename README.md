# Python Decode and Encode

###This is a program designed to decode or encode a given string for a set number of times with basic user inputs.

**The user inputs are:**
    * encode or decode
    * base64, base32, or base16
    * Number of times to decode/encode (integer)
    * String to decode/encode (Place inside double quotes)

I am still very new to programming and will update this program as I learn more.
