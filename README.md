# Python Decode and Encode

###This is a program designed to decode or encode a given string for a set number of times with basic user inputs.

**The user inputs are:**

    1. encode or decode
    2. base64, base32, or base16
    3. Number of times to decode/encode (integer)
    4. String to decode/encode (Place inside double quotes)

I am still very new to programming and will update this program as I learn more.
