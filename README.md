# python_encoder_and_decoder

This is a program designed to decode or encode a given string with basic user inputs.

The user inputs are:
    1. encode or decode
    2. base64, base32, or base16
    3. Number of times to decode/encode (integer)
    4. String to decode/encode (Place inside double quotes)

If you will not need to have this program decode or encode multiple times,
just comment out the print and input under section 3. Ammount, and the variable
count under section 1. Variables.

I am still very new to programming and will update this program as I learn more.
